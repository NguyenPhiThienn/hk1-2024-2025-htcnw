                        Back for another year, every night, the Sunny Acres Corn
                        Maze becomes the Sunny Acres Haunted Maze. This season's
                        maze begins with an encounter with an evil organist
                        (played by the Council Bluff Choir's own Glenn Frye).
                        Explore the maze and find the zombie graveyard, the
                        pumpkin tower, and a haunted house made of corn, not to
                        mention the spiders, ghosts, witches, and other assorted
                        villainy that inhabit the maze.

                    The Haunted Maze is open the last three weekends of October
                    with a special event on Halloween. Come early in the day to
                    explore the larger Corn Maze, stay for a homemade meal of
                    brats and burgers, soda, and chips, and then participate in
                    the Halloween Festival. Special stations will be set up in
                    the Haunted Maze for trick-or-treaters. A smaller maze is
                    also available that is "scare-friendly" for younger
                    children.

                    <br>We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.
